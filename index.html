        <div class="tab__content show" data-tab="1">The first patient is a farmer, who was bitten by a timber
            rattlesnake. However, when the anti-venom is given, he
            suffers an allergic reaction. The results of venom testing leads House to believe the farmer's symptoms
            cannot be from
            a snakebite. Out of options, House informs the patient of his impending death. The farmer quickly changes
            priority,
            wondering what will happen to his dog. House deduces that the bite was caused by his pet, and that this was
            not the
            first time it happened. Dr. Foreman (Omar Epps) and Dr. Chase (Jesse Spencer) return to the farmer's field
            and take a
            sample of the dog's saliva, revealing a form of strep bacteria, more commonly known as flesh-eating
            bacteria. The
            farmer's right leg is amputated and his dog is euthanized, but he is given a prosthetic new leg as well as
            a new dog.</div>
        <div class="tab__content" data-tab="2">The second patient is a female volleyball player. Dr. Cameron (Jennifer
            Morrison) believes the patient suffers from
            tendinitis due to her thyroid gland causing a depressed mental state in response to the patient's boy
            problems,
            resulting in the inflammation of the tendons. While tests confirm tendinitis, the Thyroxine the patient is
            given to
            level her moods does not work and the team becomes stumped when the patient develops hypersensitivity to
            touch and
            raised calcium levels. Chase theorizes parathyroid adenoma and an MRI is done to confirm. The scan reveals
            she has
            osteosarcoma, a cancerous tumor on her femur. Cameron warns the patient and her parents that depending on
            how large and
            ingrained the tumor is, amputation might be the only way to recovery. However, her leg is not amputated and
            she makes a
            full recovery.</div>
        <div class="tab__content" data-tab="3">The last patient is Carmen Electra enjoying a round of miniature golf,
            however, as House's lecture continues, the
            patient is revealed to be a male golfer with extreme right leg pain (Electra was a part of House's
            fantasy). While
            being examined, the patient grabs a syringe of Demerol and self-administers the injection. The students
            deduce the
            patient was here just for narcotics. When he tells the students that the patient begins urinating blood and
            waste, they
            are stumped as to the cause, which greatly angers House. Cameron shows up at the lecture, diagnosing muscle
            death. As
            Foreman and Chase also arrive, House states an MRI was done to confirm, revealing an aneurysm that clotted,
            leading to
            an infarction. Cameron deduces the patient in the third scenario was House all along.</div>
